## üéÆ Play Online (Deployed Version)

> üîó **Frontend (Vercel):** [https://shareorsteal.vercel.app](https://shareorsteal.vercel.app/)  
> üîê **Smart Contract (Sepolia Testnet):** Deployed and connected to frontend.

### How to Play:

1. üîê Connect your MetaMask wallet (Sepolia network).
2. üìù Sign up with a username.
3. üí∞ Place your ETH bet (or leave at 0 to play risk-free).

- ‚öîÔ∏è Both Choose Steal: üò¨ Mutual greed! Just 1 point each.
- üéØ 10 Rounds: üéâ Hit the target score to double your ETH bet üí∏.

### Requirements:
- MetaMask installed and set to **Sepolia Testnet**

## üîß Run Frontend Locally & Connect to Deployed Smart Contract (Sepolia)

This section helps you host the frontend locally and interact with the smart contract already deployed on the **Sepolia Testnet**.

### üöÄ Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ Node.js & npm installed
- ‚úÖ MetaMask wallet connected to Sepolia Testnet
- ‚úÖ ETH in your wallet from [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com)

### üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Run Locally (Frontend + Deployed Smart Contract)

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vipbondre/game_of_life.git
   cd game_of_life

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you're in the project directory:

   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Start the Frontend**

   Use any of the following methods to serve your frontend locally:

   - üß™ **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Use VS Code Live Server  
     Right-click on `index.html` ‚Üí `Open with Live Server`

   - üß™ **Option 2**: Use live-server from terminal  
     (If not installed, first run: `npm install -g live-server`)

     ```bash
     npx live-server
     ```

5. **Interact with the DApp**

   - Connect MetaMask (ensure you're on the **Sepolia** test network).
   - Play the game: Sign up, place a bet, and start the challenge üéØ.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** You must be logged in via MetaMask to play the game.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Total dApp Local Setup

This section will guide you through setting up **Hardhat** to host the smart contract locally, compiling the contract, deploying it on a local network, and connecting it to your frontend.

### 1. **Install Hardhat and Dependencies**

   - First, make sure you have the required dependencies installed for Hardhat and related tools.

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox ethers
   ```

### 2. Initialize Hardhat Project

- Run this command and follow the prompts:

```bash
npx hardhat
```
- Choose "Create a JavaScript project"
- Press Enter for all default options

### 3. Compile the Smart Contract

   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
### 4. Required Files
      hardhat.config.js
      scripts/deploy.js
      contracts/PrisonersDilemma.sol

### 5. Start Local Hardhat Node
   - In a new terminal, run:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```
   - This will start a local blockchain on http://127.0.0.1:8545
   - It also provides you with 20 pre-funded accounts and their private keys.

### 6. Deploy to Localhost Network
   - In a separate terminal, deploy your contract to the local node:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```
   - You'll see the deployed contract address in the terminal.

### 7. Update Frontend to Connect with Local Contract
   - In your JavaScript frontend code:
   - Use the deployed contract address from step 6
   - Load the ABI from the generated artifacts/contracts/PrisonersDilemma.sol/PrisonersDilemma.json

### 8. Run Frontend Locally
   - Use Live Server or npx live-server to host the frontend as usual. 
   - Make sure MetaMask is set to Localhost 8545 and import one of the test accounts from the Hardhat node using its private key.

### 9. Add Local Network to MetaMask
   - Open MetaMask, Click the Network dropdown at the top and choose Add Network (or "Add Network Manually").
   - Fill in the following:

   - New RPC URL	http://127.0.0.1:8545
   - Chain ID	31337
   - Currency Symbol	ETH

   - Click Save.

### 10. Setup Complete
   - You can now run live server and setup metamask account.
   - Enjoy the game.
